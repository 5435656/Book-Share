    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>BookOcean is a community for exchanging, sharing and trading books</p>
    <p>BookOcean lets you give away books you no longer need in exchange for books you really want.</p>
    <p><strong>Give & receive:</strong> Every time you give someone a book, you earn a point and can get any book you want from anyone else at BookOcean. Once you've read a book, you can keep it forever or put it back into BookOcean for someone else, as you wish.</p>
    <p><strong>No cost:</strong> There is no cost to join or use this web site: your only cost is mailing your books to others.</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback score:</strong> Each time you receive a book, you can leave feedback with the sender, just like how eBay does it. If you keep your feedback score up, people are most likely to help you out when you ask for a book.</p>
    <p><strong>Why create this?:</strong> If you're passionate about books, you know how emotionally difficult it is to throw a book away, even if you will never read it again. You want to find a good home for your books, have them find someone who appreciates them. Also, you may be interested in trying a lot of books out, and keep the ones that are great. It's a great crime to have a book disappear, out of print, for none to read. BookOcean keeps books in circulation, and finds new readers for them.</p>
